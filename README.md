pl-oauth2client-for-google
==========================

Oauth2 client for installed applications flow, for Swi-prolog, for Google Developer Accounts 

Tested with Google Compute Engine API, Windows XP (Windows 8 should work), Firefox, SWI-Prolog version 7.1.26. Needs a superuser/main user account for the redirection from user consent page (this is not the copy&paste authentication code version)

This is a installed application flow: https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#installed

This is my first Github project and first collaborative project, so I will be making lots of newbie errors
